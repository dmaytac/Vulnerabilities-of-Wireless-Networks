<h2>Evil Twin Attach</h2>
<br/>
<p>In the first attack scenario, we use a tool called Fluxion. The purpose of the attack is to obtain the password by creating a twin access point. The attack is split into two parts. The first part is intended to capture the 4-way handshake. In the second part, we will create a fake twin access point, to recover the password. After opening the Fluxion tool, first the target must be selected and then a 4-way handshake must be recorded. The attack was done on a local network.</p>

<p>In the picture 1.1 is the interface of the Fluxion tool. To get the 4 -way handshake, press 2, then enter (Handshake Snooper).</p>
